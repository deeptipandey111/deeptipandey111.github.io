      <h2>Identification</h2>
      <p>I keep looking around for design problems to solve. Sometimes there are problems that do not really concern or interest me. But when they do, I note them down as one of the potential problems to solve. This helps me always have a long to do list and access this list when I have the time to pick up a challenge.</p>

      <h2>Conceptualization</h2>
      <p>In this step I take the problem and take a while to think about it. I take the idea and let it marinate over a period of time
Laying it on the map: In this step, I like to lay out the possible ideas, without leaving out the wildest thoughts and put them out physically on a map to think more about them. Sometimes sticky notes help to lay it out and help me see it so clearly.</p>

      <p>Then I pick the top 5 “most interesting” ideas and look up what has already been done, to do a kind of a market analysis to see what has been done or explored in the past to solve this particular problem</p>

      <h2>Interview</h2>
      <p>Once I have a grasp on what has been done in this area before, I try to find a fresh perspective from actual users. Even when I learn concepts in SI 501 class, I understand that users might actually have needs very different from what they look in my mind. It is almost amazing to find how many times the problem statement changes by the mere process of a diverse set of interviews.</p>

      <p>After the job is done and dusted, I like to make a document around it for my own future reference. When I revisit these thought 6-8 months later, I can reflect upon what I could have done better to achieve the same goal in a more efficient style.</p>
